This is supposed to be one of our projects in one of the hackathons but due to the technical issues we had we were not able to go forward with this project. 

Our initial goal was to compile and run the wrf API and then use them in our AI to have the informaiton where the wind is blowing, therefore to help the peopl who are near a place that got burned recently could find out that the air could be contaminated with the fire. 

Our mission was to serve the people who lived closely to the fire that happend in Los Angles California.
